Sass-Cascading-Pages
====================

This is a sass mixin that will create the cascading pages effect.

Include the file in your sass project.

Use @include casc_pages( $colors, $width); where ever you want to use the effect.

  $colors is a list of colors (any number of colors greater than 0).
  $width is the width of the border of each page.
